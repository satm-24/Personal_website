                <p id="about__text-1">My ultimate goal is to eventually become a full-stack developer and, using my
                    skill in design and problem-solving, build something <b>revolutionary</b>. I’m currently trying to
                    master the basics of frontend technologies and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                    React, while building my skills in Java, which I’d say is my strongest language. One of my biggest
                    interests is finance/investing, and I like to build projects that associate finance as well as my
                    other interests into my love for
                    programming. In fact, one of my more recent projects was a cryptocurrency price tracker, in which I
                    used an API to get real-time crypto prices. </p>
                <br>

                <p id="about__text-2">
                    Some of my other interests include sports, video games, weightlifting, and music. Though I wasn’t
                    born in the states and moved around a lot as a kid, I’m proud to call myself a true Bostonian and
                    I’m a HUGE Patriots, Red Sox, Celtics, and Bruins fan. I’m grateful to have the opportunity to go to
                    school in my home city, and being at Northeastern has given me a lot more opportunities to network
                    and explore. </p>
